		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has captured the hearts and
			appetites of food lovers around the world. Characterized by its layered
			structure, lasagna typically consists of sheets of pasta interspersed with
			rich fillings, such as a hearty meat sauce, creamy béchamel, or a robust
			marinara, along with a generous sprinkling of cheese. The most common
			cheese used is ricotta, often blended with egg and herbs, while mozzarella
			and Parmesan are essential for that gooey, golden-brown top. The dish is
			often baked until bubbling and fragrant, creating a delightful contrast
			between the tender pasta, savory fillings, and melted cheese.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beyond its delicious taste, lasagna is a dish steeped in tradition and
			versatility. Families often pass down their unique recipes, each adding
			personal touches, such as vegetables, different meats, or even seafood.
			This adaptability allows lasagna to cater to various dietary preferences,
			with vegetarian and vegan versions gaining popularity. Whether served at a
			cozy family gathering or a festive celebration, lasagna embodies comfort
			and warmth, making it a beloved centerpiece on dining tables around the
			globe. Its ability to bring people together over a shared meal further
			solidifies its status as a timeless culinary favorite.
