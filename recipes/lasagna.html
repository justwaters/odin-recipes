			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has captured the hearts and
				appetites of food lovers around the world. Characterized by its layered
				structure, lasagna typically consists of sheets of pasta interspersed
				with rich fillings, such as a hearty meat sauce, creamy béchamel, or a
				robust marinara, along with a generous sprinkling of cheese. The most
				common cheese used is ricotta, often blended with egg and herbs, while
				mozzarella and Parmesan are essential for that gooey, golden-brown top.
				The dish is often baked until bubbling and fragrant, creating a
				delightful contrast between the tender pasta, savory fillings, and
				melted cheese.
