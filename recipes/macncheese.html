			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				Homemade mac and cheese is a comforting dish that has the power to evoke
				nostalgia and warmth, making it a favorite for people of all ages. At
				its core, this beloved classic consists of tender pasta enveloped in a
				rich, creamy cheese sauce. The process begins by cooking elbow macaroni
				until al dente, while simultaneously preparing a béchamel sauce made
				from butter, flour, and milk. Once the sauce thickens, a generous amount
				of cheese—often a blend of sharp cheddar, mozzarella, and maybe a hint
				of Gruyère—is stirred in until it melts into a velvety mixture. The
				result is a luscious, cheesy coating that clings to each piece of pasta,
				creating a dish that is both indulgent and satisfying.
